# DotFiles
All my dotfiles and configurations for window manager, application launcher, etc.
new update: vimrc and i3lock updates.

### i3 config file available in the i3 folder. I3lock -> blurs screen
To make sure the i3lock.sh works, change the file to executable.
i.e., chmod +x i3lock.sh
### polybar config file in the polybar directory

### VIM
Colorscheme used for vim is in the /vim directory, which is inspired by the atom's dark colorscheme. Just copy the file 'onedark.vim' to /usr/share/vim/vim82/colors/onedark.vimand in the vimrc file, (if not written yet), write:
colorscheme onedark

and it should be all good.
